# dotfiles
Here are my dotfiles for the Arch + Hyprland setup I'm running (very generic ik). I've been wanting to try out sth like sway or niri, but I don't want to screw up my files again :)

## Setup:
Basic Info
Macbook Air (13-inch, Early 2015)
Linux (Arch btw) + Hyprland
NotoSansMono (11pt)
Catppuccin (Macchiato)
